Repository for my Final year project in DIT. Final year project in BSc. Computer Science.

HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION


- Open the project using Android Studio (note: errors could occur from long file name sizes).
- Initialise an emulator, or use a mobile device attached to the computer via usb, 
    and click the green "play" arrow in the toolbar.
- *Wait*
- The application should now be running on the emulator or plugged in device.




NOTE ABOUT THE GIT HUB REPOSITORY:
The master branch for this repository is having conflict issues with some files that android manages in this development branch.
For all intensive purposes, the branch "simple_coordinate_system" should be considered 
  the MASTER branch for this project and repository.
